Certainly, let's go through each part of the code in even more detail to clarify how it rotates the matrix 90 degrees clockwise. Weâ€™ll use the example matrix:

csharp
Copy code
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
This will be transformed by first transposing it and then reversing each row.

Step 1: Transpose the Matrix
Goal of Transpose: Swap elements across the main diagonal so that matrix[i][j] becomes matrix[j][i]. This converts rows into columns.

The matrix has dimensions 3x3, so we loop through each i and j where j <= i to perform the swaps.

Transpose Iterations
i = 0

j = 0: Swap matrix[0][0] with matrix[0][0] (no change)
Result: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
i = 1

j = 0: Swap matrix[1][0] with matrix[0][1]

Before swap: matrix[1][0] = 4, matrix[0][1] = 2
After swap: matrix[1][0] becomes 2, matrix[0][1] becomes 4
Intermediate Result: [[1, 4, 3], [2, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

j = 1: Swap matrix[1][1] with matrix[1][1] (no change)

Result: [[1, 4, 3], [2, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

i = 2

j = 0: Swap matrix[2][0] with matrix[0][2]

Before swap: matrix[2][0] = 7, matrix[0][2] = 3
After swap: matrix[2][0] becomes 3, matrix[0][2] becomes 7
Intermediate Result: [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 6], [3, 8, 9]]

j = 1: Swap matrix[2][1] with matrix[1][2]

Before swap: matrix[2][1] = 8, matrix[1][2] = 6
After swap: matrix[2][1] becomes 6, matrix[1][2] becomes 8
Intermediate Result: [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]

j = 2: Swap matrix[2][2] with matrix[2][2] (no change)

Result: [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]

Transposed Matrix:

1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9
Step 2: Reverse Each Row
Goal of Row Reversal: Reversing each row transforms the matrix into a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

Row Reversals
Row 0: [1, 4, 7]

Swap matrix[0][0] with matrix[0][2]
Before swap: matrix[0][0] = 1, matrix[0][2] = 7
After swap: matrix[0][0] becomes 7, matrix[0][2] becomes 1
Result: [[7, 4, 1], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
Row 1: [2, 5, 8]

Swap matrix[1][0] with matrix[1][2]
Before swap: matrix[1][0] = 2, matrix[1][2] = 8
After swap: matrix[1][0] becomes 8, matrix[1][2] becomes 2
Result: [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [3, 6, 9]]
Row 2: [3, 6, 9]

Swap matrix[2][0] with matrix[2][2]
Before swap: matrix[2][0] = 3, matrix[2][2] = 9
After swap: matrix[2][0] becomes 9, matrix[2][2] becomes 3
Final Result: [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]
Final Rotated Matrix
The matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation:

7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3
Explanation Recap
Transpose: This step rearranges the rows and columns.
Row Reversal: Each row is reversed to complete the clockwise rotation.
Output
The final printed matrix is:

lua
Rotated Matrix:
[[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]
